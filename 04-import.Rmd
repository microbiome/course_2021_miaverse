# Importing microbiome data

This section demonstrates how to import microbiome profiling data in R.


The _biom_ format is a standard file format for microbiome data. Here,
we import _biom_ data files into a specific data container (structure)
in R. Specifically, we use a _TreeSummarizedExperiment_ (TSE) data
container. This provides the basis for the _miaverse_ data science
framework.

We use example data from the following publication: Tengeler AC _et
al._ (2020) [**Gut microbiota from persons with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in
mice**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00816-x). Microbiome
8:44. In this study, mice are colonized with microbiota from
participants with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and
healthy participants.  The aim of the study was to assess whether the
mice display ADHD behaviors after being inoculated with ADHD
microbiota, suggesting a role of the microbiome in ADHD pathology.

## Data access and example of importing data

You can download the data from
