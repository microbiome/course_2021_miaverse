# Alpha diversity

This notebook calculates alpha diversity indices. 

Alpha diversity is a quantity that measures diversity of taxa in one
sample.  Higher numbers of unique taxa, and more even abundance
distributions within a sample yield larger values for alpha diversity.

Alpha diversity is an important quantity in microbiome research. The
mia package provides access to a wide variety of alpha diversity
indices. As an example, we show how to calculate Shannon and Faith
diversity indices.

Shannon index reflects how many different taxa there are and how
evenly they are distributed within a sample. Faith index additionally
takes into account the phylogenetic relations between the taxa when
quantifying the overall community diversity. In both indices, higher
values represent higher diversity.


```{r}
# Indices to be calculated. If we don't specify indices, by default, every index
# is calculated.
indices <- c("shannon", "faith")

# Indices are stored in colData (i.e., sample metadata). We can specify the name
# of column, or we can use the default name which is the name of index 
# (i.e., "shannon" and "faith"). 
names <- c("Shannon_index", "Faith_diversity_index")

# Calculates indices
tse <- estimateDiversity(tse, index = indices, name = names)

# Shows the calculated indices
knitr::kable(head(colData(tse)[names]))
```

Next we can visualize Shannon index with histogram.

```{r}
# ggplot needs data.frame as input. Because colData is DataFrame, it needs to be 
# converted. 
shannon_hist <- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), 
                       aes(x = Shannon_index)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "gray", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Shannon index", y = "Sample frequency")

shannon_hist
```

```{r}
# # Same thing but done differently
# # Creates histogram. With "break", number of bins can be specified. However, the
# # value is taken as a suggestion, because hist() uses pretty() to calculate breakpoints.
# hist(colData(tse)$Shannon_index, col = "green", breaks = 20,
# xlab = "Shannon index",
# ylab = "Sample frequency",
# main = "Histogram of Shannon index")

```

To see, if there is dependency between Shannon and Faith, we can do cross-plot i.e., 
scatter plot, where one index is on the x-axis and another on the y-axis.

It seems that, there is a positive correlation between these two indices. 

```{r}
# # Does the same thing but differently
# plot(colData(tse)$Shannon_index, colData(tse)$Faith_diversity_index,
#      xlab = "Shannon index",
#      ylab = "Faith diversity index",
#      main = "plot()") +
#   # Adds regression line
#   abline(lm(colData(tse)$Faith_diversity_index ~ colData(tse)$Shannon_index)) 

cross_plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), 
                                     aes(x = Shannon_index, y = Faith_diversity_index)) + 
  geom_point() + # Adds points
  geom_smooth(method=lm) + # Adds regression line
  xlab("Shannon index") + # x axis title
  ylab("Faith diversity index")  # y axis title

cross_plot
```


## Visualization

Next let's compare indices between different genotypes and diets. Boxplot is 
suitable for that purpose. 

```{r}
# Creates Shannon boxplot 
shannon_box <- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = patient_status, 
                                                       y = Shannon_index, fill = cohort)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 12)) # makes titles smaller

# Creates Faith boxplot 
faith_box <- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = patient_status, 
                                                     y = Faith_diversity_index, 
                                                     fill = cohort)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 12)) # makes titles smaller

# Puts them into same picture
gridExtra::grid.arrange(shannon_box, faith_box, nrow = 2)

```


## Statistical testing and comparisons

To further investigate if patient status explains the variation of Shannon index, let's 
do Wilcoxon test. 

Wilcoxon test is similar to Student's t-test, however, Student's t-test is parametric.
It means that the data must be normally distributed. Wilcoxon test is non-parametric
so it doesn't make any assumptions about the distribution. 

Wilcoxon test tests if there are statistical differences between two groups. 
Here it tests, if ADHD and control groups have different Shannon index values.
As we can see, there is no difference between groups, because p-value is over 0.05, 
which is often used as a standard cutoff point.

```{r}
# Wilcoxon test, where Shannon index is the variable that we are comparing. 
# Patient status - ADHD or control - is the factor that we use for grouping. 
wilcoxon_shannon <- wilcox.test(Shannon_index ~ patient_status, data = colData(tse))

wilcoxon_shannon
```

Another test that we can make is to test if ADHD samples differs between different
cohorts. From boxplot that we made in previous step, we can see that there might 
be statistically significant difference between different cohorts.

Let's compare Shannon index of ADHD samples between cohort 2 and cohort 3.

As we can see, there is statistically significant difference between the cohorts.

```{r}
# Takes subset of colData. Takes only ADHD samples
ADHD_shannon <- colData(tse)[ colData(tse)[, "patient_status"] == "ADHD" , ]

# Takes subset of colData. Takes only samples that are in cohort 2 or cohort 3.
ADHD_shannon <- ADHD_shannon[ ADHD_shannon[, "cohort"] %in% c("Cohort_2", "Cohort_3") , ]

# Wilcoxon test, where Shannon index is the variable that we are comparing. 
# Cohort - 2 or 3 - is the factor that we use for grouping. 
wilcoxon_shannon_ADHD_cohorts <- wilcox.test(Shannon_index ~ cohort, data = ADHD_shannon)

wilcoxon_shannon_ADHD_cohorts
```
