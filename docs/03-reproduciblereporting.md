Reproducible reporting is the starting point for robust interactive
data science. Perform the following tasks:

 * Create a Rmarkdown template in RStudio, and render it into a
   document (markdown, PDF, docx or other format)

 * If you are entirely new to Markdown, take
   [this](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) 10 minute tutorial to get
   introduced to the most important functions within Markdown. Then
   experiment with different options with
   [Rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

In case you are new to Rmarkdown [Rstudio provides
resources](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to learn
about the use cases and the basics of Rmarkdown. A good online
tutorial to reproducible reporting is available by [Dr. C Titus
Brown](https://rpubs.com/marschmi/RMarkdown).
