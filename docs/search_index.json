R (version &gt;4.1.0) RStudio; choose “Rstudio Desktop” to download the latest version. Optional but preferred. For further details, check the Rstudio home page. Install and load the required R packages. After a successful installation you can start with the case study examples in this training material 3.2 Support and resources For additional reading and online material, see Material section For online support on installation and other matters, you can join us at: Users: miaverse Gitter channel Developers: Bioconductor Slack #microbiomeexperiment channel (ask for an invitation) 3.3 Installing and loading the required R packages This section shows how to install and load all required packages into the R session. Only uninstalled packages are installed. # List of packages that we need from cran and bioc cran_pkg &lt;- c(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ecodist&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;gridExtra&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;vegan&quot;) bioc_pkg &lt;- c(&quot;ANCOMBC&quot;, &quot;ape&quot;, &quot;DESeq2&quot;, &quot;DirichletMultinomial&quot;, &quot;mia&quot;, &quot;miaViz&quot;) # Gets those packages that are already installed cran_pkg_already_installed &lt;- cran_pkg[ cran_pkg %in% installed.packages() ] bioc_pkg_already_installed &lt;- bioc_pkg[ bioc_pkg %in% installed.packages() ] # Gets those packages that need to be installed cran_pkg_to_be_installed &lt;- setdiff(cran_pkg, cran_pkg_already_installed) bioc_pkg_to_be_installed &lt;- setdiff(bioc_pkg, bioc_pkg_already_installed) # If there are packages that need to be installed, installs them from CRAN if( length(cran_pkg_to_be_installed) ) { install.packages(cran_pkg_to_be_installed) } # If there are packages that need to be installed, installs them from Bioconductor if( length(bioc_pkg_to_be_installed) ) { BiocManager::install(bioc_pkg_to_be_installed, ask = F) } Now all required packages are installed, so let’s load them into the session. Some function names occur in multiple packages. That is why miaverse’s packages mia and miaViz are prioritized. Packages that are loaded first have higher priority. # Reorders bioc packages, so that mia and miaViz are first bioc_pkg &lt;- c(bioc_pkg[ bioc_pkg %in% c(&quot;mia&quot;, &quot;miaViz&quot;) ], bioc_pkg[ !bioc_pkg %in% c(&quot;mia&quot;, &quot;miaViz&quot;) ] ) # Loading all packages into session. Returns true if package was successfully loaded. sapply(c(bioc_pkg, cran_pkg), require, character.only = TRUE) ## mia miaViz ANCOMBC ## TRUE TRUE TRUE ## ape DESeq2 DirichletMultinomial ## TRUE TRUE TRUE ## BiocManager bookdown dplyr ## TRUE TRUE TRUE ## ecodist ggplot2 gridExtra ## TRUE TRUE TRUE ## knitr vegan ## TRUE TRUE "]]
