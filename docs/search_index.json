Taxa-wise variance is estimated. These values tell how much each taxa varies between samples. A curve is fitted over all those taxa-wise variance estimates that we got in the last step. This model tells how big the variance is in a specific abundance level. The model is used to shrink those individual variance estimates to avoid the effect of, e.g., small sample size and higher variance. This reduces the likelihood to get false positives. Variance estimates are used to compare different groups. We receive a result that shows whether the variance is explained by groups. "]]
