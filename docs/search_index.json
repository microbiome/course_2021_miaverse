Frontiers in Microbiology 12:11. 1.1 Introduction This course is based on miaverse (mia = MIcrobiome Analysis) is an R/Bioconductor framework for microbiome data science. It aims to extend the capabilities of another popular framework, phyloseq. The miaverse framework consists of an efficient data structure, an associated package ecosystem, demonstration data sets, and open documentation. These are explained in more detail in the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis. This training material walks you through an example workflow that shows the standard steps of taxonomic data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization and reporoducible reporting. You can run the workflow by simply copy-pasting the examples. For advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the OMA book, or try to apply the techniques to your own data. 1.2 Learning goals This course provides an overview of the standard bioinformatics workflow in taxonomic profiling studies, ranging from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and reproducible reporting, with a focus on examples from human gut microbiota studies. You will become familiar with standard bioinformatics concepts and methods in taxonomic profiling studies of the human microbiome. This includes better understanding of the specific statistical challenges, practical hands-on experience with the commonly used methods, and reproducible research with R. After the course you will know how to approach new tasks in microbiome data science by utilizing available documentation and R tools. Target audience Advanced students and applied researchers who wish to develop their skills in microbial community analysis. Venue Radboud University / Online, Nijmegen.

The biom format is a standard file format for microbiome data. Here, we import biom data files into a specific data container (structure) in R. Specifically, we use a TreeSummarizedExperiment (TSE) data container. This provides the basis for the miaverse data science framework. We use example data from the following publication: Tengeler AC et al. (2020) Gut microbiota from persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in mice. Microbiome 8:44. In this study, mice are colonized with microbiota from participants with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and healthy participants. The aim of the study was to assess whether the mice display ADHD behaviors after being inoculated with ADHD microbiota, suggesting a role of the microbiome in ADHD pathology. 4.1 Data access and example of importing data You can download the data from data subfolder. To get tips for importing biom files into R, see the online book for examples on data exploration and manipulation. "],["microbiome-data-exploration.html", "5 Microbiome data exploration 5.1 Investigate 5.2 Manipulate 5.3 Visualize", " 5 Microbiome data exploration Now we have loaded the data set into R and confirmed that it has all the necessary components. Next, let us walk through some basic operations for data exploration. 5.1 Investigate Dimensionality tells us, how many taxa and samples the data contains. As we can see, there are 151 taxa and 27 samples. ## [1] 151 27 The rowData slot contains a taxonomic table. This includes taxonomic information for each of the 151 entries. With the head() command, we can print just the beginning of the table. The rowData seems to contain information from 6 different taxonomy classes. Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus 1726470 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 1726471 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 17264731 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides 17264726 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 1726472 Bacteria Verrucomicrobia Verrucomicrobiae Verrucomicrobiales Verrucomicrobiaceae Akkermansia 17264724 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides The colData slot contains sample metadata. It contains information for all 27 samples. However, here only the 6 first samples are shown as we use the head() command. There are 4 columns, that contain information, e.g., about patients’ status, and cohort. patient_status cohort patient_status_vs_cohort sample_name A110 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A110 A12 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A12 A15 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A15 A19 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A19 A21 ADHD Cohort_2 ADHD_Cohort_2 A21 A23 ADHD Cohort_2 ADHD_Cohort_2 A23 From here, we can draw summaries of the sample (column) data, for instance to see what is the patient status distribution. The command colData(tse)$patient_status fetches the data from the column, and table() creates a table that shows how many times each class is present, and sort() sorts the table to ascending order. There are 13 samples from patients having ADHD, and 14 control samples. ## ## ADHD Control ## 13 14 5.2 Manipulate 5.2.1 Transformations Microbial abundances are typically ‘compositional’ (relative) in the current microbiome profiling data sets. This is due to technical aspects of the data generation process (see e.g. Gloor et al., 2017). The next example calculates relative abundances as these are usually easier to interpret than plain counts. For some statistical models we need to transform the data into other formats as explained in above link (and as we will see later). A variety of standard transformations for microbiome data are available for TSE data objects through mia R package. 5.2.2 Aggregation Microbial species can be called at multiple taxonomic resolutions. We can easily agglomerate the data based on taxonomic ranks. Here, we agglomerate the data at Phylum level. ## [1] 5 27 Now there are 5 taxa and 27 samples, meaning that there are 5 different Phylum level taxonomic groups. Looking at the rowData after agglomeration shows all Firmicutes are combined together, and all lower rank information is lost. From the assay we can see that all abundances of taxa that belong to Firmicutes are summed up. Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Bacteroidetes Bacteria Bacteroidetes NA NA NA NA Verrucomicrobia Bacteria Verrucomicrobia NA NA NA NA Proteobacteria Bacteria Proteobacteria NA NA NA NA Firmicutes Bacteria Firmicutes NA NA NA NA Cyanobacteria Bacteria Cyanobacteria NA NA NA NA If you are sharp, you have by now noticed that all the aggregated values in the above example are NA’s (missing data). This is because the agglomeration is missing abundances for certain taxa, and in that case the sum is not defined by default (na.rm = FALSE). We can ignore the missing values in summing up the data by setting na.rm = TRUE; then the taxa that do not have information in specified level will be removed. Those taxa that do not have information in specified level are agglomerated at lowest possible level that is left after agglomeration. Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Family:Lachnospiraceae Bacteria Firmicutes Clostridia Clostridiales Lachnospiraceae Order:Bacteroidales Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Order:Clostridiales Bacteria Firmicutes Clostridia Clostridiales Family:Enterobacteriaceae Bacteria Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Enterobacteriales Enterobacteriaceae Order:Gastranaerophilales Bacteria Cyanobacteria Melainabacteria Gastranaerophilales Here agglomeration is done similarly, but na.rm = TRUE ## [1] &quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = FALSE: 54 taxa.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = TRUE: 49 taxa.&quot; The mia package contains further examples on various data agglomeration and splitting options. 5.3 Visualize The miaViz package facilitates data visualization. Let us plot the Phylum level abundances. ## Scale for &#39;y&#39; is already present. Adding another scale for &#39;y&#39;, which will replace the existing scale. Density plot shows the overall abundance distribution for a given taxonomic group. Let us check the relative abundance of Firmicutes across the sample collection. The density plot is a smoothened version of a standard histogram. The plot shows peak abundances around 30 %. For more visualization options and examples, see the miaViz vignette. "],["alpha-diversity.html", "6 Alpha diversity 6.1 Visualization 6.2 Statistical testing and comparisons", " 6 Alpha diversity This section demonstrates the analysis of alpha diversity. This quantity measures microbial diversity within each sample. Higher numbers of unique taxa, and more even abundance distributions within a sample yield larger values for alpha diversity in general. Alpha diversity is a key quantity in a microbiome research. The mia package provides access to a wide variety of alpha diversity indices. For more background information and examples with various alpha diversity indices, see the online book. Let us show how to calculate to different diversity indices, Shannon and Faith. Shannon index reflects how many different taxa there are and how evenly they are distributed within a sample. Faith index additionally takes into account the phylogenetic relations into account. Shannon_diversity Faith_diversity A110 1.765407 7.39224 A12 2.716438 6.29378 A15 3.178103 6.60608 A19 2.891987 6.79708 A21 2.841979 6.65110 A23 2.797942 5.96246 Next we can visualize Shannon index with histogram. Next, let us compare the indices based on a scatter-plot. ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 6.1 Visualization Next let us compare indices between different patient status and cohorts. Boxplot is suitable for that purpose. For an alternative visualization, see examples with scater::plotColData. 6.2 Statistical testing and comparisons To further investigate if patient status could explain the variation of Shannon index, let’s do a Wilcoxon test. This is a non-parametric test that doesn’t make specific assumptions about the distribution, unlike popular parametric tests, such as the t test, which assumes normally distributed observations. Wilcoxon test can be used to estimate whether the differences between two groups is statistically significant. Here the ADHD and control groups are not significantly different between groups (p-value is over 0.05). ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum exact test ## ## data: Shannon_diversity by patient_status ## W = 76, p-value = 0.4879 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Another test that we can make is to test if ADHD samples differs between different cohorts. From boxplot that we made in previous step, we can see that there might be statistically significant difference between different cohorts. Let’s compare Shannon index of ADHD samples between cohort 2 and cohort 3. As we can see, there is statistically significant difference between the cohorts. ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum exact test ## ## data: Shannon_diversity by cohort ## W = 20, p-value = 0.01587 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 For more examples, see a dedicated section on alpha diversity in the online book. "],["beta-diversity.html", "7 Beta diversity 7.1 Examples of PCoA with different settings 7.2 Highlighting external variables 7.3 Estimating associations with an external variable", " 7 Beta diversity Beta diversity is another name for sample dissimilarity. It quantifies differences in the overall taxonomic composition between two samples. Common indices include Bray-Curtis, Unifrac, Jaccard index, and the Aitchison distance. Each of these (dis)similarity measures emphasizes different aspects. For example, UniFrac incorporates phylogenetic information, and Jaccard index ignores exact abundances and considers only presence/absence values. For more background information and examples, you can check the dedicated section in online book. 7.1 Examples of PCoA with different settings Beta diversity estimation generates a (dis)similarity matrix that contains for each sample (rows) the dissimilarity to any other sample (columns). This complex set of pairwise relations can be visualized in informative ways, and even coupled with other explanatory variables. As a first step, we compress the information to a lower dimensionality, or fewer principal components, and then visualize sample similarity based on that using ordination techniques, such as Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). PCoA is a non-linear dimension reduction technique, and with Euclidean distances it is is identical to the linear PCA (except for potential scaling). We typically retain just the two (or three) most informative top components, and ignore the other information. Each sample has a score on each of these components, and each component measures the variation across a set of correlated taxa. The top components are then easily visualized on a two (or three) dimensional display. Let us next look at some concrete examples. 7.1.1 PCoA for ASV-level data with Bray-Curtis Let us start with PCoA based on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix calculated at Genus level abundances. 7.1.2 PCoA for ASV-level data with Aitchison distance Now the same using Aitchison distance. This metric corresponds to Euclidean distances between CLR transformed sample abundance vectors. 7.1.3 PCoA aggregated to Phylum level We use again the Aitchison distances in this example but this time applied to the phylum level. 7.2 Highlighting external variables We can map other variables on the same plot for example by coloring the points accordingly. 7.2.1 Discrete grouping variable shown with colors 7.2.2 PCoA plot with continuous variable We can do the same as above using any continuous variable. E.g. let us see how the plotted samples differ in their alpha diversity (as an example of a continuous variable): 7.3 Estimating associations with an external variable Next to visualizing whether any variable is associated with differences between samples, we can also quantify the strength of the association between community composition (beta diversity) and external factors. The standard way to do this is to perform a so-called permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). This method takes as input the abundance table, which measure of distance you want to base the test on and a formula that tells the model how you think the variables are associated with each other. ## [1] &quot;Different different cohorts and variance of abundance \\n between samples, p-value: 0.7519&quot; The cohort variable is not significantly associated with microbiota composition (p-value is over 0.05). We can, however, visualize those taxa whose abundances drive the differences between cohorts. We first need to extract the model coefficients of taxa: The above plot shows taxa as code names, and it is hard to tell which bacterial groups they represent. However, it is easy to add human readable names. We can fetch those from our rowData. Here we use Genus level names: There are many alternative and complementary methods for analysing community composition. For more examples, see a dedicated section on beta diversity in the online book. As for community typing, a dedicated section presenting examples of analytical methods is found at the online book. "],["differential-abundance-analysis.html", "8 Differential abundance analysis 8.1 Wilcoxon test 8.2 DESeq2 8.3 ANCOM-BC 8.4 Comparison of Wilcoxon test and DESeq2 8.5 Comparison of abundance", " 8 Differential abundance analysis Here, we analyse abundances with three different methods: Wilcoxon test, DESeq2, and ANCOM-BC. All of these test statistical differences between groups. We analyse Genus level abundances. 8.1 Wilcoxon test A Wilcoxon test estimates difference between two groups. It is a non-parametric alternative to a t-test, which means that the Wilcoxon test does not require normally distributed data. Let’s first collect the data for the testing purpose. Now we can do the Wilcoxon test. We test all the taxa by looping through columns, and store individual p-values to a vector. Then we create a data frame from collected data. Code below does the Wilcoxon test only for columns that contain abundances, not for column that contain patient status. Multiple tests were performed. These are not independent, so we need to adjust p-values for multiple testing. Otherwise, we would increase the chance of a type I error drastically depending on our p-value threshold. By applying a p-value adjustment, we can keep the false positive rate at a level that is acceptable. What is acceptable depends on our research goals. Here we use the fdr method, but there are several other methods as well. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 8.2 DESeq2 Our second analysis method is DESeq2. This performs the data normalization automatically. It also takes care of the p-value adjustment, so we don’t have to worry about that. DESeq2 uses negative binomial distribution to detect differences in read counts between groups. Its normalization takes care of the differences between library sizes and compositions. DESeq2 analysis includes multiple steps, but they are done automatically. More information can be found, e.g., from Harvard Chan Bioinformatic Core’s tutorial Introduction to DGE - ARCHIVED Now let us show how to do this. First, run the DESeq2 analysis. ## converting counts to integer mode ## Warning in DESeqDataSet(tse_genus, ~patient_status): 2 duplicate rownames were renamed by adding numbers ## Warning in DESeqDataSet(tse_genus, ~patient_status): some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors ## estimating size factors ## estimating dispersions ## gene-wise dispersion estimates ## mean-dispersion relationship ## final dispersion estimates ## fitting model and testing ## -- replacing outliers and refitting for 11 genes ## -- DESeq argument &#39;minReplicatesForReplace&#39; = 7 ## -- original counts are preserved in counts(dds) ## estimating dispersions ## fitting model and testing baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE stat pvalue padj taxon Genus:Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 22.548297 -24.891268 2.460684 -10.115589 0.0000000 0.0000000 Genus:Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 Order:Bacteroidales 40.353733 -9.241798 2.136205 -4.326270 0.0000152 0.0002730 Order:Bacteroidales Genus:Faecalibacterium 231.079502 -7.074433 1.745612 -4.052694 0.0000506 0.0006835 Genus:Faecalibacterium Genus:Catabacter 18.045614 -6.615454 1.716150 -3.854823 0.0001158 0.0012508 Genus:Catabacter Genus:Butyricicoccus 2.392885 -5.179608 2.948055 -1.756957 0.0789251 0.3278426 Genus:Butyricicoccus Order:Gastranaerophilales 2.067972 -3.054975 2.938641 -1.039588 0.2985315 0.7269742 Order:Gastranaerophilales 8.3 ANCOM-BC The analysis of composition of microbiomes with bias correction (ANCOM-BC) is a recently developed method for differential abundance testing. It is based on an earlier published approach. This method could be recommended as part of several approaches: A recent study compared several mainstream methods and found that among another method, ANCOM-BC produced the most consistent results and is probably a conservative approach. Please note that based on this and other comparisons, no single method can be recommended across all datasets. Rather, it could be recommended to apply several methods and look at the overlap/differences. As the only method, ANCOM-BC incorporates the so called sampling fraction into the model. The latter term could be empirically estimated by the ratio of the library size to the microbial load. Variations in this sampling fraction would bias differential abundance analyses if ignored. Furthermore, this method provides p-values, and confidence intervals for each taxon. It also controls the FDR and it is computationally simple to implement. As we will see below, to obtain results, all that is needed is to pass a phyloseq object to the ancombc() function. Therefore, below we first convert our tse object to a phyloseq object. Then, we specify the formula. In this formula, other covariates could potentially be included to adjust for confounding. Please check the function documentation to learn about the additional arguments that we specify below. The object out contains all relevant information. Again, see the documentation of the function under Value for an explanation of all the output objects. Our question can be answered by looking at the res object, which now contains dataframes with the coefficients, standard errors, p-values and q-values. Conveniently, there is a dataframe diff_abn. Here, we can find all differentiallt abundant taxa. Below we show the first 6 entries of this dataframe: patient_statusControl 172647198 FALSE 1726478 FALSE 172647201 FALSE 17264798 FALSE 172647195 FALSE 1726472 FALSE In total, this method detects 13 differentially abundant taxa. 8.4 Comparison of Wilcoxon test and DESeq2 Let’s compare results that we got from the Wilcoxon test and DESeq2. As we can see from the scatter plot, DESeq2 gives lower p-values than Wilcoxon test. Prints number of p-values under 0.05 ## [1] &quot;DESeq2 p-values under 0.05: 7/54&quot; ## [1] &quot;Wilcoxon test p-values under 0.05: 2/54&quot; 8.5 Comparison of abundance In previous steps, we got information which taxa vary between ADHD and control groups. Let’s plot those taxa in the boxplot, and compare visually if abundances of those taxa differ in ADHD and control samples. For comparison, let’s plot also taxa that do not differ between ADHD and control groups. Let’s first gather data about taxa that have highest p-values. Next, let’s do the same but for taxa with lowest p-values. Then we can plot these six different taxa. Let’s arrange them into the same picture.

Taxa-wise variance is estimated. These values tell how much each taxa varies between samples. A curve is fitted over all those taxa-wise variance estimates that we got in the last step. This model tells how big the variance is in a specific abundance level. The model is used to shrink those individual variance estimates to avoid the effect of, e.g., small sample size and higher variance. This reduces the likelihood to get false positives. Variance estimates are used to compare different groups. We receive a result that shows whether the variance is explained by groups. "]]
