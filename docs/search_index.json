(2021) Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in Human Microbiome Studies: Contemporary Challenges and Solutions. Frontiers in Microbiology 12:11. 1.1 The miaverse framework The miaverse (mia = MIcrobiome Analysis) is an R/Bioconductor framework for microbiome data science. It aims to extend the capabilities of another popular framework, phyloseq. The miaverse framework consists of an efficient data structure, an associated package ecosystem, demonstration data sets, and open documentation. These are explained in more detail in the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis. This training material walks you through an example workflow that shows the standard steps of taxonomic data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization and reporoducible reporting. You can run the workflow by simply copy-pasting the examples. For advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the OMA book, or try to apply the techniques to your own data. 1.2 Learning goals This course provides an overview of the standard bioinformatics workflow in taxonomic profiling studies, ranging from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and reproducible reporting, with a focus on examples from human gut microbiota studies. You will become familiar with standard bioinformatics concepts and methods in taxonomic profiling studies of the human microbiome. This includes better understanding of the specific statistical challenges, practical hands-on experience with the commonly used methods, and reproducible research with R. After the course you will know how to approach new tasks in microbiome data science by utilizing available documentation and R tools. Target audience Advanced students and applied researchers who wish to develop their skills in microbial community analysis. Venue Radboud University / Online, Nijmegen.

The biom format is a standard file format for microbiome data. Here, we import biom data files into a specific data container (structure) in R. Specifically, we use a TreeSummarizedExperiment (TSE) data container. This provides the basis for the miaverse data science framework. We use example data from the following publication: Tengeler AC et al. (2020) Gut microbiota from persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in mice. Microbiome 8:44. In this study, mice are colonized with microbiota from participants with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and healthy participants. The aim of the study was to assess whether the mice display ADHD behaviors after being inoculated with ADHD microbiota, suggesting a role of the microbiome in ADHD pathology. 4.1 Data access and example of importing data You can download the data from data subfolder. To get tips for importing biom files into R, see the online book for examples on data exploration and manipulation. "],["microbiome-data-exploration.html", "5 Microbiome data exploration 5.1 Investigate 5.2 Manipulate 5.3 Visualize", " 5 Microbiome data exploration Now we have loaded the data set into R and confirmed that it has all the necessary components. Next, let us walk through some basic operations for data exploration. 5.1 Investigate Dimensionality tells us, how many taxa and samples the data contains. As we can see, there are 151 taxa and 27 samples. dim(tse) ## [1] 151 27 The rowData slot contains a taxonomic table. This includes taxonomic information for each of the 151 entries. With the head() command, we can print just the beginning of the table. The rowData seems to contain information from 6 different taxonomy classes. knitr::kable(head(rowData(tse))) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus 1726470 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 1726471 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 17264731 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides 17264726 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 1726472 Bacteria Verrucomicrobia Verrucomicrobiae Verrucomicrobiales Verrucomicrobiaceae Akkermansia 17264724 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides The colData slot contains sample metadata. It contains information for all 27 samples. However, here only the 6 first samples are shown as we use the head() command. There are 4 columns, that contain information, e.g., about patients’ status, and cohort. knitr::kable(head(colData(tse))) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) patient_status cohort patient_status_vs_cohort sample_name A110 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A110 A12 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A12 A15 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A15 A19 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A19 A21 ADHD Cohort_2 ADHD_Cohort_2 A21 A23 ADHD Cohort_2 ADHD_Cohort_2 A23 From here, we can draw summaries of the sample (column) data, for instance to see what is the patient status distribution. The command colData(tse)$patient_status fetches the data from the column, and table() creates a table that shows how many times each class is present, and sort() sorts the table to ascending order. There are 13 samples from patients having ADHD, and 14 control samples. sort(table(colData(tse)$patient_status)) ## ## ADHD Control ## 13 14 5.2 Manipulate 5.2.1 Transformations Microbial abundances are typically ‘compositional’ (relative) in the current microbiome profiling data sets. This is due to technical aspects of the data generation process (see e.g. Gloor et al., 2017). The next example calculates relative abundances as these are usually easier to interpret than plain counts. For some statistical models we need to transform the data into other formats as explained in above link (and as we will see later). # Calculates relative abundances, and stores the table to assays tse &lt;- transformCounts(tse, method = &quot;relabundance&quot;) A variety of standard transformations for microbiome data are available for TSE data objects through mia R package. 5.2.2 Aggregation Microbial species can be called at multiple taxonomic resolutions. We can easily agglomerate the data based on taxonomic ranks. Here, we agglomerate the data at Phylum level. tse_phylum &lt;- agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Phylum&quot;) # Show dimensionality dim(tse_phylum) ## [1] 5 27 Now there are 5 taxa and 27 samples, meaning that there are 5 different Phylum level taxonomic groups. Looking at the rowData after agglomeration shows all Firmicutes are combined together, and all lower rank information is lost. From the assay we can see that all abundances of taxa that belong to Firmicutes are summed up. knitr::kable(head(rowData(tse_phylum))) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Bacteroidetes Bacteria Bacteroidetes NA NA NA NA Verrucomicrobia Bacteria Verrucomicrobia NA NA NA NA Proteobacteria Bacteria Proteobacteria NA NA NA NA Firmicutes Bacteria Firmicutes NA NA NA NA Cyanobacteria Bacteria Cyanobacteria NA NA NA NA If you are sharp, you have by now noticed that all the aggregated values in the above example are NA’s (missing data). This is because the agglomeration is missing abundances for certain taxa, and in that case the sum is not defined by default (na.rm = FALSE). We can ignore the missing values in summing up the data by setting na.rm = TRUE; then the taxa that do not have information in specified level will be removed. Those taxa that do not have information in specified level are agglomerated at lowest possible level that is left after agglomeration. temp &lt;- rowData(agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Genus&quot;)) # Prints those taxa that do not have information at the Genus level knitr::kable(head(temp[temp$Genus == &quot;&quot;,])) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Family:Lachnospiraceae Bacteria Firmicutes Clostridia Clostridiales Lachnospiraceae Order:Bacteroidales Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Order:Clostridiales Bacteria Firmicutes Clostridia Clostridiales Family:Enterobacteriaceae Bacteria Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Enterobacteriales Enterobacteriaceae Order:Gastranaerophilales Bacteria Cyanobacteria Melainabacteria Gastranaerophilales Here agglomeration is done similarly, but na.rm = TRUE temp2 &lt;- rowData(agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Genus&quot;, na.rm = TRUE)) print(paste0(&quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = FALSE: &quot;, dim(temp)[1], &quot; taxa.&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = FALSE: 54 taxa.&quot; print(paste0(&quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = TRUE: &quot;, dim(temp2)[1], &quot; taxa.&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = TRUE: 49 taxa.&quot; The mia package contains further examples on various data agglomeration and splitting options. 5.3 Visualize The miaViz package facilitates data visualization. Let us plot the Phylum level abundances. # Here we specify &quot;relabundance&quot; to be abundance table that we use for plotting. # Note that we can use agglomerated or non-agglomerated tse as an input, because # the function agglomeration is built-in option. # Legend does not fit into picture, so its height is reduced. plot_abundance &lt;- plotAbundance(tse, abund_values=&quot;relabundance&quot;, rank = &quot;Phylum&quot;) + theme(legend.key.height = unit(0.5, &quot;cm&quot;)) + scale_y_continuous(label = scales::percent) ## Scale for &#39;y&#39; is already present. Adding another scale for &#39;y&#39;, which will replace the existing scale. plot_abundance Density plot shows the overall abundance distribution for a given taxonomic group. Let us check the relative abundance of Firmicutes across the sample collection. The density plot is a smoothened version of a standard histogram. The plot shows peak abundances around 30 %. # Subset data by taking only Firmicutes tse_firmicutes &lt;- tse_phylum[&quot;Firmicutes&quot;] # Gets the abundance table abundance_firmicutes &lt;- assay(tse_firmicutes, &quot;relabundance&quot;) # Creates a data frame object, where first column includes abundances firmicutes_abund_df &lt;- as.data.frame(t(abundance_firmicutes)) # Rename the first and only column colnames(firmicutes_abund_df) &lt;- &quot;abund&quot; # Creates a plot.

"],["alpha-diversity.html", "6 Alpha diversity 6.1 Visualization 6.2 Statistical testing and comparisons 6.3 Further resources", " 6 Alpha diversity This section demonstrates how alpha diversity indices are calculated. Alpha diversity is a quantity that measures diversity of taxa in within the sample. Higher numbers of unique taxa, and more even abundance distributions within a sample yield larger values for alpha diversity. Alpha diversity is an important quantity in a microbiome research. The mia package provides access to a wide variety of alpha diversity indices. As an example, we show how to calculate Shannon and Faith diversity indices. Shannon index reflects how many different taxa there are and how evenly they are distributed within a sample. Faith index additionally takes into account the phylogenetic relations between the taxa when quantifying the overall community diversity. In both indices, higher values represent higher diversity. # Indices to be calculated. If we don&#39;t specify indices, by default, every index # is calculated. indices &lt;- c(&quot;shannon&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;) # Indices are stored in colData (i.e., sample metadata).

Because colData is DataFrame, it needs to be # converted. shannon_hist &lt;- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = Shannon_index)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = &quot;gray&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Shannon index&quot;, y = &quot;Sample frequency&quot;) shannon_hist # # Same thing but done differently # # Creates histogram. With &quot;break&quot;, number of bins can be specified. However, the # # value is taken as a suggestion, because hist() uses pretty() to calculate breakpoints. # hist(colData(tse)$Shannon_index, col = &quot;green&quot;, breaks = 20, # xlab = &quot;Shannon index&quot;, # ylab = &quot;Sample frequency&quot;, # main = &quot;Histogram of Shannon index&quot;) To see, if there is dependency between Shannon and Faith, we can do cross-plot i.e., scatter plot, where one index is on the x-axis and another on the y-axis. It seems that, there is a positive correlation between these two indices. # # Does the same thing but differently # plot(colData(tse)$Shannon_index, colData(tse)$Faith_diversity_index, # xlab = &quot;Shannon index&quot;, # ylab = &quot;Faith diversity index&quot;, # main = &quot;plot()&quot;) + # # Adds regression line # abline(lm(colData(tse)$Faith_diversity_index ~ colData(tse)$Shannon_index)) cross_plot &lt;- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = Shannon_index, y = Faith_diversity_index)) + geom_point() + # Adds points geom_smooth(method=lm) + # Adds regression line xlab(&quot;Shannon index&quot;) + # x axis title ylab(&quot;Faith diversity index&quot;) # y axis title cross_plot ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 6.1 Visualization Next let’s compare indices between different patient status and cohorts. Boxplot is suitable for that purpose. # Creates Shannon boxplot shannon_box &lt;- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = patient_status, y = Shannon_index, fill = cohort)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(title = element_text(size = 12)) # makes titles smaller # Creates Faith boxplot faith_box &lt;- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = patient_status, y = Faith_diversity_index, fill = cohort)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(title = element_text(size = 12)) # makes titles smaller # Puts them into same picture gridExtra::grid.arrange(shannon_box, faith_box, nrow = 2) 6.2 Statistical testing and comparisons To further investigate if patient status explains the variation of Shannon index, let’s do a Wilcoxon test. The Wilcoxon test is similar to a Student’s t-test, however, the Student’s t-test is parametric. It means that the data must be normally distributed. The Wilcoxon test is non-parametric so it doesn’t make any assumptions about the distribution. The Wilcoxon test tests if there are statistical differences between two groups. Here it tests, if ADHD and control groups have different Shannon index values. As we can see, there is no difference between groups, because the p-value is over 0.05, which is often used as a standard cutoff point. # Wilcoxon test, where Shannon index is the variable that we are comparing. # Patient status - ADHD or control - is the factor that we use for grouping. wilcoxon_shannon &lt;- wilcox.test(Shannon_index ~ patient_status, data = colData(tse)) wilcoxon_shannon ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum exact test ## ## data: Shannon_index by patient_status ## W = 76, p-value = 0.4879 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Another test that we can make is to test if ADHD samples differs between different cohorts. From boxplot that we made in previous step, we can see that there might be statistically significant difference between different cohorts. Let’s compare Shannon index of ADHD samples between cohort 2 and cohort 3. As we can see, there is statistically significant difference between the cohorts. # Takes subset of colData. Takes only ADHD samples ADHD_shannon &lt;- colData(tse)[ colData(tse)[, &quot;patient_status&quot;] == &quot;ADHD&quot; , ] # Takes subset of colData. Takes only samples that are in cohort 2 or cohort 3. ADHD_shannon &lt;- ADHD_shannon[ ADHD_shannon[, &quot;cohort&quot;] %in% c(&quot;Cohort_2&quot;, &quot;Cohort_3&quot;) , ] # Wilcoxon test, where Shannon index is the variable that we are comparing. # Cohort - 2 or 3 - is the factor that we use for grouping. wilcoxon_shannon_ADHD_cohorts &lt;- wilcox.test(Shannon_index ~ cohort, data = ADHD_shannon) wilcoxon_shannon_ADHD_cohorts ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum exact test ## ## data: Shannon_index by cohort ## W = 20, p-value = 0.01587 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 6.3 Further resources For more examples, see a dedicated section on alpha diversity in the online book. "],["beta-diversity.html", "7 Beta diversity 7.1 Examples of PCoA with different settings 7.2 Highlighting external variables on PCoA plot 7.3 Estimating associations with an external variable 7.4 Further resources", " 7 Beta diversity In this section, we go through how to calculate and visualize beta diversity. Beta diversity reflects the difference in microbial composition between samples. Unlike alpha diversity, where we calculate diversity within a sample, any particular beta diversity value can only be calculated between two samples. There are different ways to measure the distance between two samples. Some of the common choices include Bray-Curtis, Unifrac, Jaccard index, and the Aitchison distance metric. Each of these (dis)similarity measures emphasizes different aspects of (dis)similarity. For example, UniFrac is a distance metric that incorporates phylogenetic information between samples. Or, the Jaccard-index measures the distance based on presence/absence of any taxon irrespective of its abundance. 7.1 Examples of PCoA with different settings After calculating beta diversity, we end up with a (dis)similarity matrix that contains for each sample the distance to any other sample. To explore our data, we would like to visualize the distances between samples and potentially map meta data into the same graph. This would enable us to explore whether distance between samples could be related to known variables. Given the many dimensions in the matrix, we first need to apply a technique that summarises most of the information into fewer dimensions (components). Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) is a technique that can achieve exactly that. As a side note for those of you familiar with Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A PCoA where you enter a matrix of Euclidean distances will be similar to a PCA of the microbial abundances (except for potential scaling differences). Back to our PCoA: Typically, we retain 2-3 components that contain most of the information in the data. Note however, that the other components might contain important information as well. After all these steps, we thus end up with 2-3 new variables (components), where each sample has a score on each of those components. We can then simply create a 2-D or a 3D plot with the components on the x and y (and z) axis. We could do the same for any combination of the many components a PCoA calculates. Enough theory, let’s try to put this into practice! 7.1.1 PCoA for ASV-level data with Bray-Curtis We will illustrate what we described above using different distance measures and also applied to different taxonomic ranks. We start with a PCoA that uses a Bray Curtis matrix as input, calculated at the Genus level. # Relative abundance table rel_abund_assay &lt;- assays(tse)$relabundance # Transposes it to get taxa to columns rel_abund_assay &lt;- t(rel_abund_assay) # Calculates Bray-Curtis distances between samples.

This metric corresponds to Euclidean distances between CLR transformed sample abundance vectors. # Does clr transformation. Pseudocount is added, because data contains zeros. tse &lt;- transformCounts(tse, method = &quot;clr&quot;, pseudocount = 1) # Gets clr table clr_assay &lt;- assays(tse)$clr # Transposes it to get taxa to columns clr_assay &lt;- t(clr_assay) # Calculates Euclidean distances between samples.

For example, by changing the color of the points based on that variable. Let’s see how we could do that: 7.2.1 PCoA with discrete sample grouping variable shown with colors # Adds the variable we later use for coloring to the data frame euclidean_patient_status_pcoa_df &lt;- cbind(euclidean_pcoa_df, patient_status = colData(tse)$patient_status) # Creates a plot euclidean_patient_status_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = euclidean_patient_status_pcoa_df, aes(x=pcoa1, y=pcoa2, color = patient_status)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Coordinate 1&quot;, y = &quot;Coordinate 2&quot;, title = &quot;PCoA with Aitchison distances&quot;) + theme(title = element_text(size = 12)) # makes titles smaller euclidean_patient_status_plot 7.2.2 PCoA plot with continuous variable We can do the same as above using any continuous variable. E.g. let us see how the plotted samples differ in their alpha diversity: # Adds coloring information to the data frame, creates new column euclidean_shannon_pcoa_df &lt;- cbind(euclidean_pcoa_df, shannon = colData(tse)$Shannon_index) # Creates a plot euclidean_shannon_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = euclidean_shannon_pcoa_df, aes(x=pcoa1, y=pcoa2, color = shannon)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Coordinate 1&quot;, y = &quot;Coordinate 2&quot;, title = &quot;PCoA with Aitchison distances&quot;) + theme(title = element_text(size = 12)) # makes titles smaller euclidean_shannon_plot 7.3 Estimating associations with an external variable Next to visualizing whether any variable is associated with differences between samples, we can also quantify the strength of the association between the variation in community composition (beta diversity) and external factors. The current standard way to do this is to perform a so-called permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). This method takes as input the ASV/OTU table, which measure of distance you want to base the test on and a formula that tells the model how you think the variables are associated with each other. Let’s try it: # First we get the relative abundance table rel_abund_assay &lt;- assays(tse)$relabundance # again transpose it to get taxa to columns rel_abund_assay &lt;- t(rel_abund_assay) # then we can perform the method permanova_cohort &lt;- vegan::adonis(rel_abund_assay ~ cohort, data = colData(tse), permutations = 9999) # we can obtain a the p value for our predictor: print(paste0(&quot;Different different cohorts and variance of abundance between samples, p-value: &quot;, as.data.frame(permanova_cohort$aov.tab)[&quot;cohort&quot;, &quot;Pr(&gt;F)&quot;])) ## [1] &quot;Different different cohorts and variance of abundance between samples, p-value: 0.7378&quot; As we see, the cohort variable is not significantly associated with microbiota composition (p-value is over 0.05). We can still visualize those taxa whose abundances are the most different between cohorts. This gives us information how taxonomic abundances tend to differ between different cohorts. In order to do that, we first need to extract the model coefficients of taxa: # Gets the coefficients coef &lt;- coefficients(permanova_cohort)[&quot;cohort1&quot;,] # Gets the highest coefficients top.coef &lt;- sort(head(coef[rev(order(abs(coef)))],20)) # Plots the coefficients top_taxa_coeffient_plot &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(x = top.coef, y = factor(names(top.coef), unique(names(top.coef)))), aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + labs(x=&quot;&quot;, y=&quot;&quot;, title=&quot;Top Taxa&quot;) + theme_bw() top_taxa_coeffient_plot The above plot shows taxa as code names, and it is hard to tell which bacterial groups they represent. However, it is easy to add human readable names. We can fetch those from our rowData. Here we use Genus level names: # Gets corresponding Genus level names and stores them to top.coef names &lt;- rowData(tse)[names(top.coef), ][,&quot;Genus&quot;] # Adds new labels to the plot top_taxa_coeffient_plot &lt;- top_taxa_coeffient_plot + scale_y_discrete(labels = names) # Adds new labels top_taxa_coeffient_plot 7.4 Further resources For more examples, see a dedicated section on beta diversity in the online book.

One technique that allows to search for groups of samples that are similar to each other is the Dirichlet-Multinomial Mixture Model. In DMM, we first determine the number of clusters (k) that best fit the data (model evidence) using Laplace approximation. After fitting the model with k clusters, we obtain for each sample k probabilities that reflect the probability that a sample belongs to the given cluster.

All of these test statistical differences between groups. We analyse Genus level abundances. 9.1 Wilcoxon test A Wilcoxon test estimates difference between two groups. It is a non-parametric alternative to a t-test, which means that the Wilcoxon test does not require normally distributed data. Let’s first collect the data for the testing purpose. # Agglomerates data to Genus level tse_genus &lt;- agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Genus&quot;) # Does clr transformation. Pseudocount is added, because data contains zeros, and # clr transformation includes log transformation. tse_genus &lt;- transformCounts(tse_genus, method = &quot;clr&quot;, pseudocount = 1) # Does transpose, so samples are in rows, then creates a data frame. abundance_analysis_data &lt;- data.frame(t(assay(tse_genus, &quot;clr&quot;))) # Then we need variable for grouping samples. &quot;patient_status&quot; column includes information # about patients&#39; status. There two groups &quot;ADHD&quot; and &quot;control&quot;. Let&#39;s include that to the data frame. abundance_analysis_data &lt;- cbind(abundance_analysis_data, patient_status = colData(tse_genus)$patient_status) Now we can do the Wilcoxon test. We test all the taxa by looping through columns, and store individual p-values to a vector. Then we create a data frame from collected data. Code below does the Wilcoxon test only for columns that contain abundances, not for column that contain patient status. colnames &lt;- names(abundance_analysis_data[, !names(abundance_analysis_data) %in% &quot;patient_status&quot;]) wilcoxon_p &lt;- c() # Initialize empty vector for p-values # Do for loop over selected column names for (i in colnames) { result &lt;- wilcox.test(abundance_analysis_data[, i] ~ patient_status, data = abundance_analysis_data) # Stores p-value to the vector with this column name wilcoxon_p[[i]] &lt;- result$p.value } wilcoxon_p &lt;- data.frame(taxa = names(wilcoxon_p), p_raw = unlist(wilcoxon_p)) Multiple tests were performed. These are not independent, so we need to adjust p-values for multiple testing. Otherwise, we would increase the chance of a type I error drastically depending on our p-value threshold. By applying a p-value adjustment, we can keep the false positive rate at a level that is acceptable. What is acceptable depends on our research goals. Here we use the fdr method, but there are several other methods as well. wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted &lt;- p.adjust(wilcoxon_p$p_raw, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(wilcoxon_p$p_raw, wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted), type=rep(c(&quot;raw&quot;, &quot;holm&quot;), c(length(wilcoxon_p$p_raw), length(wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted)))) wilcoxon_plot &lt;- ggplot(df) + geom_histogram(aes(x=x, fill=type)) + labs(x = &quot;p-value&quot;, y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) wilcoxon_plot ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 9.2 DESeq2 Our second analysis method is DESeq2. This performs the data normalization automatically. It also takes care of the p-value adjustment, so we don’t have to worry about that. DESeq2 uses negative binomial distribution to detect differences in read counts between groups. Its normalization takes care of the differences between library sizes and compositions. DESeq2 analysis includes multiple steps, but they are done automatically. More information can be found, e.g., from Harvard Chan Bioinformatic Core’s tutorial Introduction to DGE - ARCHIVED Now let us show how to do this. First, run the DESeq2 analysis. # Creates DESeq2 object from the data. Uses &quot;patient_status&quot; to create groups. ds2 &lt;- DESeqDataSet(tse_genus, ~patient_status) ## converting counts to integer mode ## Warning in DESeqDataSet(tse_genus, ~patient_status): 2 duplicate rownames were renamed by adding numbers ## Warning in DESeqDataSet(tse_genus, ~patient_status): some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors # Does the analysis dds &lt;- DESeq(ds2) ## estimating size factors ## estimating dispersions ## gene-wise dispersion estimates ## mean-dispersion relationship ## final dispersion estimates ## fitting model and testing ## -- replacing outliers and refitting for 11 genes ## -- DESeq argument &#39;minReplicatesForReplace&#39; = 7 ## -- original counts are preserved in counts(dds) ## estimating dispersions ## fitting model and testing # Gets the results from the object res &lt;- results(dds) # Creates a data frame from results df &lt;- as.data.frame(res) # Adds taxon column that includes names of taxa df$taxon &lt;- rownames(df) # Orders the rows of data frame in increasing order firstly based on column &quot;log2FoldChange&quot; # and secondly based on &quot;padj&quot; column df &lt;- df %&gt;% arrange(log2FoldChange, padj) knitr::kable(head(df)) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE stat pvalue padj taxon Genus:Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 22.548297 -24.891268 2.460684 -10.115589 0.0000000 0.0000000 Genus:Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 Order:Bacteroidales 40.353733 -9.241798 2.136205 -4.326270 0.0000152 0.0002730 Order:Bacteroidales Genus:Faecalibacterium 231.079502 -7.074433 1.745612 -4.052694 0.0000506 0.0006835 Genus:Faecalibacterium Genus:Catabacter 18.045614 -6.615454 1.716150 -3.854823 0.0001158 0.0012508 Genus:Catabacter Genus:Butyricicoccus 2.392885 -5.179608 2.948055 -1.756957 0.0789251 0.3278426 Genus:Butyricicoccus Order:Gastranaerophilales 2.067972 -3.054975 2.938641 -1.039588 0.2985315 0.7269742 Order:Gastranaerophilales 9.3 ANCOM-BC The analysis of composition of microbiomes with bias correction (ANCOM-BC) is a recently developed method for differential abundance testing. It is based on an earlier published approach. This method could be recommended as part of several approaches: A recent study compared several mainstream methods and found that among another method, ANCOM-BC produced the most consistent results and is probably a conservative approach. Please note that based on this and other comparisons, no single method can be recommended across all datasets. Rather, it could be recommended to apply several methods and look at the overlap/differences. As the only method, ANCOM-BC incorporates the so called sampling fraction into the model. The latter term could be empirically estimated by the ratio of the library size to the microbial load. Variations in this sampling fraction would bias differential abundance analyses if ignored. Furthermore, this method provides p-values, and confidence intervals for each taxon. It also controls the FDR and it is computationally simple to implement. As we will see below, to obtain results, all that is needed is to pass a phyloseq object to the ancombc() function. Therefore, below we first convert our tse object to a phyloseq object. Then, we specify the formula. In this formula, other covariates could potentially be included to adjust for confounding. Please check the function documentation to learn about the additional arguments that we specify below. # currently, ancombc requires the phyloseq format, but we can easily convert: pseq &lt;- makePhyloseqFromTreeSummarizedExperiment(tse) pseq_genus &lt;- phyloseq::tax_glom(pseq, taxrank = &quot;Genus&quot;) out = ancombc( phyloseq = pseq_genus, formula = &quot;patient_status&quot;, p_adj_method = &quot;holm&quot;, zero_cut = 0.90, lib_cut = 0, group = &quot;patient_status&quot;, struc_zero = TRUE, neg_lb = TRUE, tol = 1e-5, max_iter = 100, conserve = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, global = TRUE ) res &lt;- out$res The object out contains all relevant information. Again, see the documentation of the function under Value for an explanation of all the output objects. Our question can be answered by looking at the res object, which now contains dataframes with the coefficients, standard errors, p-values and q-values. Conveniently, there is a dataframe diff_abn. Here, we can find all differentiallt abundant taxa. Below we show the first 6 entries of this dataframe: knitr::kable(head(res$diff_abn)) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) patient_statusControl 172647198 FALSE 1726478 FALSE 172647201 FALSE 17264798 FALSE 172647195 FALSE 1726472 FALSE In total, this method detects 13 differentially abundant taxa. 9.4 Comparison of Wilcoxon test and DESeq2 Let’s compare results that we got from the Wilcoxon test and DESeq2. As we can see from the scatter plot, DESeq2 gives lower p-values than Wilcoxon test. mf &lt;- data.frame(df$padj, wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted) p &lt;- ggplot(mf, aes(x = df$padj, y = wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted)) + labs(x = &quot;DESeq2 adjusted p-value&quot;, y = &quot;Wilcoxon test adjusted p-value&quot;) + geom_count() + scale_size_area(max_size = 10) print(p) Prints number of p-values under 0.05 print(paste0(&quot;DESeq2 p-values under 0.05: &quot;, sum(df$padj&lt;0.05, na.rm = TRUE), &quot;/&quot;, length(df$padj))) ## [1] &quot;DESeq2 p-values under 0.05: 7/54&quot; print(paste0(&quot;Wilcoxon test p-values under 0.05: &quot;, sum(wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted&lt;0.05, na.rm = TRUE), &quot;/&quot;, length(wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted))) ## [1] &quot;Wilcoxon test p-values under 0.05: 2/54&quot; 9.5 Comparison of abundance In previous steps, we got information which taxa vary between ADHD and control groups. Let’s plot those taxa in the boxplot, and compare visually if abundances of those taxa differ in ADHD and control samples. For comparison, let’s plot also taxa that do not differ between ADHD and control groups. Let’s first gather data about taxa that have highest p-values. # There are some taxa that do not include Genus level information. They are # excluded from analysis. # str_detect finds if the pattern is present in values of &quot;taxon&quot; column. # Subset is taken, only those rows are included that do not include the pattern. df &lt;- df[ !stringr::str_detect(df$taxon, &quot;Genus:uncultured&quot;), ] # Sorts p-values in decreasing order. Takes 3rd first ones. Takes those rows that match # with p-values. Takes taxa. highest3 &lt;- df[df$padj %in% sort(df$padj, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3], ]$taxon # From clr transformed table, takes only those taxa that had highest p-values highest3 &lt;- assay(tse_genus, &quot;clr&quot;)[highest3, ] # Transposes the table highest3 &lt;- t(highest3) # Adds colData that includes patient status infomation highest3 &lt;- data.frame(highest3, as.data.frame(colData(tse_genus))) # Some taxa names are that long that they don&#39;t fit nicely into title. So let&#39;s add there # a line break after e.g. &quot;Genus&quot;. Here the dot after e.g. Genus is replaced with # &quot;: \\n&quot; colnames(highest3)[1:3] &lt;- lapply(colnames(highest3)[1:3], function(x){ # Replaces the first dot temp &lt;- stringr::str_replace(x, &quot;[.]&quot;, &quot;: &quot;) # Replace all other dots and underscores with space temp &lt;- stringr::str_replace_all(temp, c(&quot;[.]&quot; = &quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot; = &quot; &quot;)) # Adds line break so that 25 characters is the maximal width temp &lt;- stringr::str_wrap(temp, width = 25) }) Next, let’s do the same but for taxa with lowest p-values. # Sorts p-values in increasing order. Takes 3rd first ones. Takes those rows that match # with p-values. Takes taxa. lowest3 &lt;- df[df$padj %in% sort(df$padj, decreasing = FALSE)[1:3], ]$taxon # From clr transformed table, takes only those taxa that had lowest p-values lowest3 &lt;-assay(tse_genus, &quot;clr&quot;)[lowest3, ] # Transposes the table lowest3 &lt;- t(lowest3) # Adds colData that includes patient status infomation lowest3 &lt;- data.frame(lowest3, as.data.frame(colData(tse_genus))) # Some taxa names are that long that they don&#39;t fit nicely into title. So let&#39;s add there # a line break after e.g. &quot;Genus&quot;. Here the dot after e.g. Genus is replaced with # &quot;: \\n&quot; colnames(lowest3)[1:3] &lt;- lapply(colnames(lowest3)[1:3], function(x){ # Replaces the first dot temp &lt;- stringr::str_replace(x, &quot;[.]&quot;, &quot;: &quot;) # Replace all other dots and underscores with space temp &lt;- stringr::str_replace_all(temp, c(&quot;[.]&quot; = &quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot; = &quot; &quot;)) # Adds line break so that 25 characters is the maximal width temp &lt;- stringr::str_wrap(temp, width = 25) }) Then we can plot these six different taxa.

Taxa-wise variance is estimated. These values tell how much each taxa varies between samples. A curve is fitted over all those taxa-wise variance estimates that we got in the last step. This model tells how big the variance is in a specific abundance level. The model is used to shrink those individual variance estimates to avoid the effect of, e.g., small sample size and higher variance. This reduces the likelihood to get false positives. Variance estimates are used to compare different groups. We receive a result that shows whether the variance is explained by groups. "]]
