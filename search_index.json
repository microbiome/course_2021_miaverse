(2021) Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in Human Microbiome Studies: Contemporary Challenges and Solutions. Frontiers in Microbiology 12:11. 1.1 Introduction This course is based on miaverse (mia = MIcrobiome Analysis) is an R/Bioconductor framework for microbiome data science. It extends another popular framework, phyloseq. The miaverse consists of an efficient data structure, an associated package ecosystem, demonstration data sets, and open documentation. These are explained in more detail in the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis. The training material walks you through an example workflow that shows the standard steps of taxonomic data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization and reporoducible reporting. You can run the workflow by simply copy-pasting the examples. For advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the OMA book, or try to apply the techniques to your own data. 1.2 Learning goals This course provides an overview of the standard bioinformatics workflow in taxonomic profiling studies, ranging from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and reproducible reporting, with a focus on examples from human gut microbiota studies. You will become familiar with standard bioinformatics concepts and methods in taxonomic profiling studies of the human microbiome. This includes better understanding of the specific statistical challenges, practical hands-on experience with the commonly used methods, and reproducible research with R. After the course you will know how to approach new tasks in microbiome data science by utilizing available documentation and R tools. Target audience Advanced students and applied researchers who wish to develop their skills in microbial community analysis. Venue Radboud University / Online, Nijmegen.

(2020) Gut microbiota from persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in mice. Microbiome 8:44. In this study, mice are colonized with microbiota from participants with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and healthy participants. The aim of the study was to assess whether the mice display ADHD behaviors after being inoculated with ADHD microbiota, suggesting a role of the microbiome in ADHD pathology. Download the data from data subfolder. Option 2 Western diet intervention study in serotonin transporter modified mouse model Mice received three weeks of Western (high fat, high sugar) or Control diet in three Genotype groups, a wild-type group and 2 groups with either partial or complete knock-out of the serotonin transporter (SERT), leading to an excess of serotonin in the gut, brain and blood circulation. Mice were measured before and after the intervention. In total there are three factors in this design, Time (pre-,post-intervention), Diet (Control, Western diet) and Genotype group (WT, HET, KO). There are about 6-8 mice per group. Data can be found from Summer School’s Brightspace. Option 3 Open data set of your own choice, see e.g.: Bioconductor microbiomeDataSets 5.2 Importing microbiome data in R Import example data by modifying the examples in the online book section on data exploration and manipulation. The data files in our example are in biom format, which is a standard file format for microbiome data. Other file formats exist as well, and import details vary by platform. Here, we import biom data files into a specific data container (structure) in R, TreeSummarizedExperiment (TSE) Huang et al. (2020). This provides the basis for downstream data analysis in the miaverse data science framework. In this course, we focus on downstream analysis of taxonomic profiling data, and assume that the data has already been appropriately preprocessed and available in the TSE format. In addition to our example data, further demonstration data sets are readily available in the TSE format through microbiomeDataSets. Figure sources: Original article - Huang R et al.

Next, let us walk through some basic operations for data exploration to confirm that the data has all the necessary components. 6.1 Data structure Let us now investigate how taxonomic profiling data is organized in R. Dimensionality tells us how many taxa and samples the data contains. As we can see, there are 151 taxa and 27 samples. dim(tse) ## [1] 151 27 The rowData slot contains a taxonomic table. This includes taxonomic information for each of the 151 entries. With the head() command, we can print just the beginning of the table. The rowData seems to contain information from 6 different taxonomy classes. knitr::kable(head(rowData(tse))) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;, latex_options=&quot;scale_down&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus 1726470 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 1726471 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 17264731 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides 17264726 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides 1726472 Bacteria Verrucomicrobia Verrucomicrobiae Verrucomicrobiales Verrucomicrobiaceae Akkermansia 17264724 Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides The colData slot contains sample metadata. It contains information for all 27 samples. However, here only the 6 first samples are shown as we use the head() command. There are 4 columns, that contain information, e.g., about patients’ status, and cohort. knitr::kable(head(colData(tse))) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;, latex_options=&quot;scale_down&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) patient_status cohort patient_status_vs_cohort sample_name A110 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A110 A12 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A12 A15 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A15 A19 ADHD Cohort_1 ADHD_Cohort_1 A19 A21 ADHD Cohort_2 ADHD_Cohort_2 A21 A23 ADHD Cohort_2 ADHD_Cohort_2 A23 From here, we can draw summaries of the sample (column) data, for instance to see what is the patient status distribution. The command colData(tse)$patient_status fetches the data from the column, and table() creates a table that shows how many times each class is present, and sort() sorts the table to ascending order. There are 13 samples from patients having ADHD, and 14 control samples. sort(table(colData(tse)$patient_status)) ## ## ADHD Control ## 13 14 6.1.1 Transformations Microbial abundances are typically ‘compositional’ (relative) in the current microbiome profiling data sets. This is due to technical aspects of the data generation process (see e.g. Gloor et al., 2017). The next example calculates relative abundances as these are usually easier to interpret than plain counts. For some statistical models we need to transform the data into other formats as explained in above link (and as we will see later). # Calculates relative abundances, and stores the table to assays tse &lt;- transformCounts(tse, method = &quot;relabundance&quot;) A variety of standard transformations for microbiome data are available for TSE data objects through mia R package. 6.1.2 Aggregation Microbial species can be called at multiple taxonomic resolutions. We can easily agglomerate the data based on taxonomic ranks. Here, we agglomerate the data at Phylum level. tse_phylum &lt;- agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Phylum&quot;) # Show dimensionality dim(tse_phylum) ## [1] 5 27 Now there are 5 taxa and 27 samples, meaning that there are 5 different Phylum level taxonomic groups. Looking at the rowData after agglomeration shows all Firmicutes are combined together, and all lower rank information is lost. From the assay we can see that all abundances of taxa that belong to Firmicutes are summed up. knitr::kable(head(rowData(tse_phylum))) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;, latex_options=&quot;scale_down&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Bacteroidetes Bacteria Bacteroidetes NA NA NA NA Verrucomicrobia Bacteria Verrucomicrobia NA NA NA NA Proteobacteria Bacteria Proteobacteria NA NA NA NA Firmicutes Bacteria Firmicutes NA NA NA NA Cyanobacteria Bacteria Cyanobacteria NA NA NA NA If you are sharp, you have by now noticed that all the aggregated values in the above example are NA’s (missing data). This is because the agglomeration is missing abundances for certain taxa, and in that case the sum is not defined by default (na.rm = FALSE). We can ignore the missing values in summing up the data by setting na.rm = TRUE; then the taxa that do not have information in specified level will be removed. Those taxa that do not have information in specified level are agglomerated at lowest possible level that is left after agglomeration. temp &lt;- rowData(agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Genus&quot;)) # Prints those taxa that do not have information at the Genus level knitr::kable(head(temp[temp$Genus == &quot;&quot;,])) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;, latex_options=&quot;scale_down&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Family:Lachnospiraceae Bacteria Firmicutes Clostridia Clostridiales Lachnospiraceae Order:Bacteroidales Bacteria Bacteroidetes Bacteroidia Bacteroidales Order:Clostridiales Bacteria Firmicutes Clostridia Clostridiales Family:Enterobacteriaceae Bacteria Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Enterobacteriales Enterobacteriaceae Order:Gastranaerophilales Bacteria Cyanobacteria Melainabacteria Gastranaerophilales Here agglomeration is done similarly, but na.rm = TRUE temp2 &lt;- rowData(agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Genus&quot;, na.rm = TRUE)) print(paste0(&quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = FALSE: &quot;, dim(temp)[1], &quot; taxa.&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = FALSE: 54 taxa.&quot; print(paste0(&quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = TRUE: &quot;, dim(temp2)[1], &quot; taxa.&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;Agglomeration with na.rm = TRUE: 49 taxa.&quot; The mia package contains further examples on various data agglomeration and splitting options. 6.2 Visualization The miaViz package facilitates data visualization. Let us plot the Phylum level abundances. # Here we specify &quot;relabundance&quot; to be abundance table that we use for plotting. # Note that we can use agglomerated or non-agglomerated tse as an input, because # the function agglomeration is built-in option. # Legend does not fit into picture, so its height is reduced. plot_abundance &lt;- plotAbundance(tse, abund_values=&quot;relabundance&quot;, rank = &quot;Phylum&quot;) + theme(legend.key.height = unit(0.5, &quot;cm&quot;)) + scale_y_continuous(label = scales::percent) ## Scale for &#39;y&#39; is already present. Adding another scale for &#39;y&#39;, which will ## replace the existing scale. plot_abundance Density plot shows the overall abundance distribution for a given taxonomic group. Let us check the relative abundance of Firmicutes across the sample collection. The density plot is a smoothened version of a standard histogram.

Prepare a reproducible report (Rmarkdown), and include the code that you use to import the data and generate the analyses. Abundance table Retrieve the taxonomic abundance table from the example data set (TSE object). Tip: check “assays” in data import section How many different samples and genus-level groups this phyloseq object has? Tips: see dim(), rowData() What is the maximum abundance of Akkermansia in this data set? Tip: aggregate the data to Genus level with agglomerateByRank, pick abundance assay, and check a given genus (row) in the assay Draw a histogram of library sizes (total number of reads per sample). Tip: Library size section in OMA. You can use the available function, or count the sum of reads per sample by using the colSums command applied on the abundance table. Check Vandeputte et al. 2017 for further discussion on the differences between absolute and relative quantification of microbial abundances. Taxonomy table Retrieve the taxonomy table and print out the first few lines of it with the R command head(). Investigate how many different phylum-level groups this phyloseq object has? Tips: rowData, taxonomicRanks in OMA. Sample metadata Retrieve sample metadata. How many patient groups this data set has? Draw a histogram of sample diversities. Tips: colData Subsetting Pick a subset of the data object including only ADHD individuals from Cohort 1. How many there are? Tips: subsetSamples Transformations The data contains read counts. We can convert these into relative abundances and other formats. Compare abundance of a given taxonomic group using the example data before and after the compositionality transformation (with a cross-plot, for instance). You can also compare the results to CLR-transformed data (see e.g. Gloor et al. 2017) Visual exploration Visualize the population distribution of abundances for certain taxonomic groups. Do the same for CLR-transformed abundances. Tip: assays, transformCounts Experiment with other data manipulation tools from OMA.

This quantity measures microbial diversity within each sample. Higher numbers of unique taxa, and more even abundance distributions within a sample yield larger values for alpha diversity. Alpha diversity is a key quantity in a microbiome research. The mia package provides access to a wide variety of alpha diversity indices. For more background information and examples with various alpha diversity indices, see the online book. Let us show how to calculate to different diversity indices, Shannon and Faith. Shannon index reflects how many different taxa there are and how evenly they are distributed within a sample. Faith index additionally takes into account the phylogenetic relations into account. # Indices to be calculated. # Every index is calculated by default if we don&#39;t specify indices. indices &lt;- c(&quot;shannon&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;) # Indices are stored in colData (i.e., sample metadata). We can specify the name # of column, or we can use the default name which is the name of index # (i.e., &quot;shannon&quot; and &quot;faith&quot;). names &lt;- c(&quot;Shannon_diversity&quot;, &quot;Faith_diversity&quot;) # Calculates indices tse &lt;- estimateDiversity(tse, index = indices, name = names) # Shows the calculated indices knitr::kable(head(colData(tse)[names])) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;, latex_options=&quot;scale_down&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) Shannon_diversity Faith_diversity A110 1.765407 7.39224 A12 2.716438 6.29378 A15 3.178103 6.60608 A19 2.891987 6.79708 A21 2.841979 6.65110 A23 2.797942 5.96246 Next we can visualize Shannon index with histogram. # ggplot needs data.frame format as input. # Here, colData is DataFrame, therefore it needs to be converted to data.frame shannon_hist &lt;- ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = Shannon_diversity)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = &quot;gray&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Shannon index&quot;, y = &quot;Sample frequency&quot;) shannon_hist Next, let us compare the indices based on a scatter-plot. cross_plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(tse)), aes(x = Shannon_diversity, y = Faith_diversity)) + geom_point() + # Adds points geom_smooth(method=lm) + # Adds regression line labs(x = &quot;Shannon index&quot;, y = &quot;Faith diversity&quot;) cross_plot ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 7.1 Visualization Next let us compare indices between different patient status and cohorts.

This is a non-parametric test that doesn’t make specific assumptions about the distribution, unlike popular parametric tests, such as the t test, which assumes normally distributed observations. Wilcoxon test can be used to estimate whether the differences between two groups is statistically significant. Here the ADHD and control groups are not significantly different between groups (p-value is over 0.05). # Wilcoxon test, where Shannon index is the variable that we are comparing. # Patient status - ADHD or control - is the factor that we use for grouping. wilcoxon_shannon &lt;- wilcox.test(Shannon_diversity ~ patient_status, data = colData(tse)) wilcoxon_shannon ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum exact test ## ## data: Shannon_diversity by patient_status ## W = 76, p-value = 0.4879 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Another test that we can make is to test if ADHD samples differs between different cohorts. From boxplot that we made in previous step, we can see that there might be statistically significant difference between different cohorts. Let’s compare Shannon index of ADHD samples between cohort 2 and cohort 3. As we can see, there is statistically significant difference between the cohorts. # Takes subset of colData. Takes only ADHD samples ADHD_shannon &lt;- colData(tse)[ colData(tse)[, &quot;patient_status&quot;] == &quot;ADHD&quot; , ] # Takes subset of colData.

It quantifies differences in the overall taxonomic composition between two samples. Common indices include Bray-Curtis, Unifrac, Jaccard index, and the Aitchison distance. Each of these (dis)similarity measures emphasizes different aspects. For example, UniFrac incorporates phylogenetic information, and Jaccard index ignores exact abundances and considers only presence/absence values. For more background information and examples, you can check the dedicated section in online book. 8.1 Examples of PCoA with different settings Beta diversity estimation generates a (dis)similarity matrix that contains for each sample (rows) the dissimilarity to any other sample (columns). This complex set of pairwise relations can be visualized in informative ways, and even coupled with other explanatory variables. As a first step, we compress the information to a lower dimensionality, or fewer principal components, and then visualize sample similarity based on that using ordination techniques, such as Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). PCoA is a non-linear dimension reduction technique, and with Euclidean distances it is is identical to the linear PCA (except for potential scaling). We typically retain just the two (or three) most informative top components, and ignore the other information. Each sample has a score on each of these components, and each component measures the variation across a set of correlated taxa. The top components are then easily visualized on a two (or three) dimensional display. Let us next look at some concrete examples. 8.1.1 PCoA for ASV-level data with Bray-Curtis Let us start with PCoA based on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix calculated at Genus level abundances. # Pick the relative abundance table rel_abund_assay &lt;- assays(tse)$relabundance # Calculates Bray-Curtis distances between samples. Because taxa is in # columns, it is used to compare different samples.

This metric corresponds to Euclidean distances between CLR transformed sample abundance vectors. # Does clr transformation. Pseudocount is added, because data contains zeros. tse &lt;- transformCounts(tse, method = &quot;clr&quot;, pseudocount = 1) # Gets clr table clr_assay &lt;- assays(tse)$clr # Transposes it to get taxa to columns clr_assay &lt;- t(clr_assay) # Calculates Euclidean distances between samples.

E.g. let us use the alcohol study dataset from curatedMetagenomicData. Perform PCoA and use the BMI as our continuous variable: # Retrieving data as a TreeSummarizedExperiment object, and agglomerating to a genus level. library(curatedMetagenomicData) library(dplyr) library(DT) # Querying the data tse_data &lt;- sampleMetadata %&gt;% filter(age &gt;= 18) %&gt;% # taking only data of age 18 or above filter(!is.na(alcohol)) %&gt;% # excluding missing values returnSamples(&quot;relative_abundance&quot;) # Agglomeration tse_genus &lt;- agglomerateByRank(tse_data, rank=&quot;Genus&quot;) Performing PCoA with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. library(scater) ## Loading required package: scuttle tse_genus &lt;- runMDS(tse_genus, FUN = vegan::vegdist, name = &quot;PCoA_BC&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;relative_abundance&quot;) # Retrieving the explained variance e &lt;- attr(reducedDim(tse_genus, &quot;PCoA_BC&quot;), &quot;eig&quot;); var_explained &lt;- e/sum(e[e&gt;0])*100 # Visualization plot &lt;-plotReducedDim(tse_genus,&quot;PCoA_BC&quot;, colour_by = &quot;BMI&quot;)+ labs(x=paste(&quot;PC1 (&quot;,round(var_explained[1],1),&quot;%)&quot;), y=paste(&quot;PC2 (&quot;,round(var_explained[2],1),&quot;%)&quot;), color=&quot;&quot;) plot 8.3 Estimating associations with an external variable Next to visualizing whether any variable is associated with differences between samples, we can also quantify the strength of the association between community composition (beta diversity) and external factors. The standard way to do this is to perform a so-called permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). This method takes as input the abundance table, which measure of distance you want to base the test on and a formula that tells the model how you think the variables are associated with each other. # First we get the relative abundance table rel_abund_assay &lt;- assays(tse)$relabundance # again transpose it to get taxa to columns rel_abund_assay &lt;- t(rel_abund_assay) # then we can perform the method permanova_cohort &lt;- vegan::adonis(rel_abund_assay ~ cohort, data = colData(tse), permutations = 9999) # we can obtain a the p value for our predictor: print(paste0(&quot;Different different cohorts and variance of abundance &quot;, &quot;between samples, p-value: &quot;, as.data.frame(permanova_cohort$aov.tab)[&quot;cohort&quot;, &quot;Pr(&gt;F)&quot;])) ## [1] &quot;Different different cohorts and variance of abundance between samples, p-value: 0.7396&quot; The cohort variable is not significantly associated with microbiota composition (p-value is over 0.05). We can, however, visualize those taxa whose abundances drive the differences between cohorts. We first need to extract the model coefficients of taxa: # Gets the coefficients coef &lt;- coefficients(permanova_cohort)[&quot;cohort1&quot;,] # Gets the highest coefficients top.coef &lt;- sort(head(coef[rev(order(abs(coef)))],20)) # Plots the coefficients top_taxa_coeffient_plot &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(x = top.coef, y = factor(names(top.coef), unique(names(top.coef)))), aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + labs(x=&quot;&quot;, y=&quot;&quot;, title=&quot;Top Taxa&quot;) + theme_bw() top_taxa_coeffient_plot The above plot shows taxa as code names, and it is hard to tell which bacterial groups they represent. However, it is easy to add human readable names. We can fetch those from our rowData. Here we use Genus level names: # Gets corresponding Genus level names and stores them to top.coef names &lt;- rowData(tse)[names(top.coef), ][,&quot;Genus&quot;] # Adds new labels to the plot top_taxa_coeffient_plot &lt;- top_taxa_coeffient_plot + scale_y_discrete(labels = names) # Adds new labels top_taxa_coeffient_plot There are many alternative and complementary methods for analysing community composition. For more examples, see a dedicated section on beta diversity in the online book. 8.4 Community typing A dedicated section presenting examples on community typing is in the online book. 8.5 Exercises Visualize community variation with different methods (PCA, MDS, t-SNE…) by using the options in the alternative method, plotReducedDim OMA. Compare results obtained with different dissimilarities (Euclidean, Bray-Curtis, Unifrac..) and transformations (CLR, compositional..) of your own choice.\" Investigate the influence of the data transformations on statistical analysis: Visualize community variation with PCoA with the following options: 1) Bray-Curtis distances for compositional data; 2) Euclidean distances for CLR-transformed data. Community-level comparisons: Use PERMANOVA to investigate whether the community composition differs between two groups of individuals (e.g. males and females, or some other grouping of your choice). You can also include covariates such as age and gender, and see how this affects the results. Perform community typing for the data using the DMM method OMA Example Solutions "],["differential-abundance-analysis.html", "Chapter 9 Differential abundance analysis 9.1 Wilcoxon test 9.2 ANCOM-BC 9.3 Comparison of the methods 9.4 Comparison of abundance", " Chapter 9 Differential abundance analysis Here, we analyse abundances with two different methods: Wilcoxon test (CLR), and ANCOM-BC. All of these test statistical differences between groups. We will analyse Genus level abundances. We might want to first perform prevalence filtering to reduce the amount of multiple tests. In this particular dataset, all genera pass a prevalence threshold of 10%, therefore, we do not perform filtering. 9.1 Wilcoxon test A Wilcoxon test estimates the difference in an outcome between two groups. It is a non-parametric alternative to a t-test, which means that the Wilcoxon test does not make any assumptions about the data. Let’s first combine the data for the testing purpose. # Agglomerates data to Genus level tse_genus &lt;- agglomerateByRank(tse, rank = &quot;Genus&quot;) # Perform clr transformation. A Pseudocount of 1 needs to be added, # because the data contains zeros and the clr transformation includes a # log transformation. tse_genus &lt;- transformCounts(tse_genus, method = &quot;clr&quot;, pseudocount = 1) # Does transpose, so samples are in rows, then creates a data frame. abundance_analysis_data &lt;- data.frame(t(assay(tse_genus, &quot;clr&quot;))) # We will analyse whether abundances differ depending on the&quot;patient_status&quot;. # There are two groups: &quot;ADHD&quot; and &quot;control&quot;. # Let&#39;s include that to the data frame. abundance_analysis_data &lt;- cbind( abundance_analysis_data, patient_status = colData(tse_genus)$patient_status ) Now we can start with the Wilcoxon test. We test all the taxa by looping through columns, and store individual p-values to a vector. Then we create a data frame from collected data. The code below does the Wilcoxon test only for columns that contain abundances, not for columns that contain patient status. genera &lt;- names(abundance_analysis_data[, !names(abundance_analysis_data) %in% &quot;patient_status&quot;]) wilcoxon_p &lt;- c() # Initialize empty vector for p-values # Do &quot;for loop&quot; over selected column names for (i in genera) { result &lt;- wilcox.test(abundance_analysis_data[, i] ~ patient_status, data = abundance_analysis_data) # Stores p-value to the vector with this column name wilcoxon_p[[i]] &lt;- result$p.value } wilcoxon_p &lt;- data.frame(taxa = names(wilcoxon_p), p_raw = unlist(wilcoxon_p)) Multiple tests were performed. These are not independent, so we need to adjust p-values for multiple testing. Otherwise, we would increase the chance of a type I error drastically depending on our p-value threshold. By applying a p-value adjustment, we can keep the false positive rate at a level that is acceptable. What is acceptable depends on our research goals. Here we use the fdr method, but there are several other methods as well. wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted &lt;- p.adjust(wilcoxon_p$p_raw, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) # prepare a dataframe to plot p values df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(wilcoxon_p$p_raw, wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted), type=rep(c(&quot;raw&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;), c(length(wilcoxon_p$p_raw), length(wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted)))) # make a histrogram of p values and adjusted p values wilcoxon_plot &lt;- ggplot(df) + geom_histogram(aes(x=x, fill=type)) + labs(x = &quot;p-value&quot;, y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) wilcoxon_plot ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 9.2 ANCOM-BC The analysis of composition of microbiomes with bias correction (ANCOM-BC) is a recently developed method for differential abundance testing. It is based on an earlier published approach. The former version of this method could be recommended as part of several approaches: A recent study compared several mainstream methods and found that among another method, ANCOM produced the most consistent results and is probably a conservative approach. Please note that based on this and other comparisons, no single method can be recommended across all datasets. Rather, it could be recommended to apply several methods and look at the overlap/differences. As the only method, ANCOM-BC incorporates the so called sampling fraction into the model. The latter term could be empirically estimated by the ratio of the library size to the microbial load. Variations in this sampling fraction would bias differential abundance analyses if ignored. Furthermore, this method provides p-values, and confidence intervals for each taxon. It also controls the FDR and it is computationally simple to implement. As we will see below, to obtain results, all that is needed is to pass a phyloseq object to the ancombc() function. Therefore, below we first convert our tse object to a phyloseq object. Then, we specify the formula. In this formula, other covariates could potentially be included to adjust for confounding. Please check the function documentation to learn about the additional arguments that we specify below. Also, see here for another example for more than 1 group comparison. # currently, ancombc requires the phyloseq format, but we can convert this easily pseq &lt;- makePhyloseqFromTreeSummarizedExperiment(tse) pseq_genus &lt;- phyloseq::tax_glom(pseq, taxrank = &quot;Genus&quot;) out = ancombc( phyloseq = pseq_genus, formula = &quot;patient_status&quot;, p_adj_method = &quot;fdr&quot;, zero_cut = 0.90, # by default prevalence filter of 10% is applied lib_cut = 0, group = &quot;patient_status&quot;, struc_zero = TRUE, neg_lb = TRUE, tol = 1e-5, max_iter = 100, conserve = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, global = TRUE ) res &lt;- out$res The object out contains all relevant information. Again, see the documentation of the function under Value for an explanation of all the output objects. Our question can be answered by looking at the res object, which now contains dataframes with the coefficients, standard errors, p-values and q-values. Conveniently, there is a dataframe diff_abn. Here, we can find all differentially abundant taxa. Below we show the first 6 entries of this dataframe: knitr::kable(head(res$diff_abn)) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(&quot;striped&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;) patient_statusControl 172647198 FALSE 1726478 FALSE 172647201 FALSE 17264798 FALSE 172647195 FALSE 1726472 FALSE In total, this method detects 14 differentially abundant taxa. print(paste0(&quot;Wilcoxon test p-values under 0.05: &quot;, sum(wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted&lt;0.05, na.rm = TRUE), &quot;/&quot;, length(wilcoxon_p$p_adjusted))) ## [1] &quot;Wilcoxon test p-values under 0.05: 2/54&quot; print(paste0(&quot;ANCOM p-values under 0.05: &quot;, sum(out$res$diff_abn$patient_statusControl), &quot;/&quot;, length(out$res$diff_abn$patient_statusControl))) ## [1] &quot;ANCOM p-values under 0.05: 14/49&quot; 9.3 Comparison of the methods TO DO: More difference abundance methods are upcoming. Comparison will be made later. 9.4 Comparison of abundance In previous steps, we got information which taxa vary between ADHD and control groups. Let’s plot those taxa in the boxplot, and compare visually if abundances of those taxa differ in ADHD and control samples. For comparison, let’s plot also taxa that do not differ between ADHD and control groups. Let’s first gather data about taxa that have highest p-values. #we used the results from the wilcoxn test df &lt;- wilcoxon_p # renaming row names and taxa column df$taxa &lt;- rownames(assay(tse_genus,&quot;clr&quot;)) # There are some taxa that do not include Genus level information.

Takes 3 first ones. Takes those rows that match # with p-values. Takes taxa. highest3 &lt;- df[df$p_adjusted %in% sort(df$p_adjusted, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3], ]$taxa # From clr transformed table, takes only those taxa that had highest p-values highest3 &lt;- assay(tse_genus, &quot;clr&quot;)[highest3, ] # Transposes the table highest3 &lt;- t(highest3) # Adds colData that includes patient status infomation highest3 &lt;- data.frame(highest3, as.data.frame(colData(tse_genus))) # Some taxa names are that long that they don&#39;t fit nicely into title. So let&#39;s add there # a line break after e.g. &quot;Genus&quot;. Here the dot after e.g. Genus is replaced with # &quot;: \\n&quot; colnames(highest3)[1:3] &lt;- lapply(colnames(highest3)[1:3], function(x){ # Replaces the first dot temp &lt;- stringr::str_replace(x, &quot;[.]&quot;, &quot;: &quot;) # Replace all other dots and underscores with space temp &lt;- stringr::str_replace_all(temp, c(&quot;[.]&quot; = &quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot; = &quot; &quot;)) # Adds line break so that 25 characters is the maximal width temp &lt;- stringr::str_wrap(temp, width = 25) }) Next, let’s do the same but for taxa with lowest p-values. # Sorts p-values in increasing order. Takes 3rd first ones. Takes those rows that match # with p-values.

In the following, we calculate the relative abundances and the top 10 taxa. The barplot is ordered by “Bacteroidetes”: library(miaViz) # Remove unwanted taxon tse &lt;- subsetTaxa(tse, rownames(tse) != &quot;-1&quot;) # Only consider Sanger technique mat &lt;- subsetSamples(tse, colData(tse)$SeqTech == &quot;Sanger&quot;) # Get top taxa rel_taxa &lt;- getTopTaxa(tse, top = 10, abund_values = &quot;counts&quot;) # Take only the top taxa mat &lt;- subsetTaxa(mat, is.element(rownames(tse), rel_taxa)) # Visualise composition barplot, with samples order by &quot;Bacteroides&quot; plotAbundance(mat, abund_values = &quot;counts&quot;, order_rank_by = &quot;abund&quot;, order_sample_by = &quot;Bacteroides&quot;) 11.1.2 Composition heatmap Community composition can be visualised with a heatmap. The colour of each intersection point represents the abundance of a taxon in a specific sample.

To help make an informed decision, we turn to previously established methods for doing so. In this section we introduce three such methods (aside from DMM analysis) to cluster similar samples. They include the Elbow Method, Silhouette Method, and Gap Statistic Method. All of them will utilise the `kmeans’ algorithm which essentially assigns clusters and minimises the distance within clusters (a sum of squares calculation). The default distance metric used is the Euclidean metric. The scree plot allows us to see how much of the variance is captured by each dimension in the MDS ordination. library(ggplot2); th &lt;- theme_bw() # reset data tse &lt;- enterotype # MDS analysis with the first 20 dimensions tse &lt;- scater::runMDS(tse, FUN = vegan::vegdist, method = &quot;bray&quot;, name = &quot;MDS_BC&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;, ncomponents = 20) ord &lt;- reducedDim(tse, &quot;MDS_BC&quot;, withDimnames = TRUE) # retrieve eigenvalues eigs &lt;- attr(ord, &quot;eig&quot;) # variance in each of the axes var &lt;- eigs / sum(eigs) # first 12 values df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1:12), y = var[1:12]) # create scree plot p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Principal Component&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Variance&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Scree Plot&quot;) p From the scree plot (above), we can see that the two principal dimensions can account for 68% of the total variation, but at least the top 4 eigenvalues are considerable. Dimensions beyond 3 and 4 may be useful so let’s try to remove the less relevant dimensions. # histogram of MDS eigenvalues from the fifth dimension onward h &lt;- hist(eigs[5:length(eigs)], 100) plot(h$mids, h$count, log = &quot;y&quot;, type = &quot;h&quot;, lwd = 10, lend = 2) As you can see, dimensions 5, 6, and 7 still stand out so we will include 7 MDS dimensions. 11.2.1 Elbow Method This method graphs the sum of the sum of squares for each \\(k\\) (number of clusters), where \\(k\\) ranges between 1 and 10. Where the bend or `elbow’ occurs is the optimal value of \\(k\\). library(factoextra) # take only first 7 dimensions NDIM &lt;- 7 x &lt;- ord[, 1:NDIM] # Elbow Method factoextra::fviz_nbclust(x, kmeans, method = &quot;wss&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 3, linetype = 2) + labs(subtitle = &quot;Elbow Method&quot;) + th As you can see, the bend occurs at \\(k=3\\), implying there are three clusters present in the enterotype data. 11.2.2 Silhouette Method This method on the otherhand returns a width for each \\(k\\). In this case, we want the \\(k\\) that maximises the width. # Silhouette method factoextra::fviz_nbclust(x, kmeans, method = &quot;silhouette&quot;) + labs(subtitle = &quot;Silhouette method&quot;) + th The graph shows the maximum occurring at \\(k=2\\). \\(k=3\\) is also strongly suggested by the plot and is consistent with what we obtained from the elbow method. 11.2.3 Gap-Statistic Method The Gap-Statistic Method is the most complicated among the methods discussed here. In the plot produced, we want the \\(k\\) value that maximises the output (local and global maxima), but we also want to pay attention to where the plot jumps if the maximum value doesn’t turn out to be helpful. # Gap Statistic Method factoextra::fviz_nbclust(x, kmeans, method = &quot;gap_stat&quot;, nboot = 50)+ labs(subtitle = &quot;Gap Statistic Method&quot;) + th \\(k=6\\) clusters, as the peak suggests, would not be very revealing since having too many clusters can cease to be revealing and so we look to the points where the graph jumps. We can see this occurs at \\(k=2\\) and \\(k=8\\). The output indicates that there are at least two clusters present. Since we have previous evidence for the existence of three clusters and \\(k=3\\) yields a higher gap statistic than \\(k=2\\), \\(k=3\\) seems to be a good choice. One could argue for the existence of two or three clusters as they are both good candidates. At times like these it helps to visualise the clustering in an MDS or NMDS plot. Now let’s divide the subjects into their respective clusters. library(cluster) # assume 3 clusters K &lt;- 3 x &lt;- ord[, 1:NDIM] clust &lt;- as.factor(pam(x, k = K, cluster.only = T)) # swapping the assignment of 2 and 3 to match ravel cst enumeration clust[clust == 2] &lt;- NA clust[clust == 3] &lt;- 2 clust[is.na(clust)] &lt;- 3 colData(tse)$CST &lt;- clust CSTs &lt;- as.character(seq(K)) Let’s take a look at the MDS ordination with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the first four dimensions. library(scater) library(RColorBrewer) library(cowplot) # set up colours CSTColors &lt;- brewer.pal(6, &quot;Paired&quot;)[c(2, 5, 3)] # Length 6 for consistency with pre-revision CST+ colouration names(CSTColors) &lt;- CSTs CSTColorScale &lt;- scale_colour_manual(name = &quot;CST&quot;, values = CSTColors) CSTFillScale &lt;- scale_fill_manual(name = &quot;CST&quot;, values = CSTColors) # plot MDS with Bray-Curtis dimensions 1 and 2 p1 &lt;- scater::plotReducedDim(tse, &quot;MDS_BC&quot;, colour_by = &quot;CST&quot;, point_alpha = 1, percentVar = var[c(1, 2)]*100) + th + labs(title = &quot;Ordination by Cluster&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # plot MDS with Bray-Curtis dimensions 3 and 4 p2 &lt;- scater::plotReducedDim(tse, &quot;MDS_BC&quot;, colour_by = &quot;CST&quot;, point_alpha = 1, ncomponents = c(3, 4), percentVar = var[c(1, 2, 3, 4)]*100) + th plot_grid(p1 + CSTColorScale, p2 + CSTColorScale, nrow = 2) And now nMDS. tse &lt;- runNMDS(tse, FUN = vegan::vegdist, method = &quot;bray&quot;, name = &quot;NMDS_BC&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;, ncomponents = 20) ##

Using all of the data again (for the top 20 taxa) and taking the z transformation of the clr transformed counts, we have # Find top 20 taxa rel_taxa &lt;- getTopTaxa(tse, top = 20) # Z transform of CLR counts mat &lt;- transformCounts(tse, abund_values = &quot;counts&quot;, method = &quot;clr&quot;, pseudocount = 1) mat &lt;- transformFeatures(mat, abund_values = &quot;clr&quot;, method = &quot;z&quot;) # Select top 20 taxa mat &lt;- subsetTaxa(mat, is.element(rownames(tse), rel_taxa)) mat &lt;- assays(mat)$z # Order CSTs mat &lt;- mat[, order(clust)] colnames(mat) &lt;- names(sort(clust)) # Plot CSTs &lt;- as.data.frame(sort(clust)) names(CSTs) &lt;- &quot;CST&quot; breaks &lt;- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 10) # Make grid for heatmap setHook(&quot;grid.newpage&quot;, function() pushViewport(viewport(x = 1, y = 1, width = 0.9, height = 0.9, name = &quot;vp&quot;, just = c(&quot;right&quot;,&quot;top&quot;))), action = &quot;prepend&quot;) pheatmap(mat, color = rev(brewer.pal(9, &quot;RdBu&quot;)), breaks = breaks, main = &quot;All CSTs&quot;, treeheight_row = 0, treeheight_col = 0, show_colnames = 0, annotation_col = CSTs, cluster_cols = F) setHook(&quot;grid.newpage&quot;, NULL, &quot;replace&quot;) grid.text(&quot;Sample&quot;, x = 0.39, y = -0.04, gp = gpar(fontsize = 16)) grid.text(&quot;Genus&quot;, x = -0.04, y = 0.47, rot = 90, gp = gpar(fontsize = 16)) 11.5 Session Info sessionInfo() ## R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] grid stats4 stats graphics grDevices utils datasets ## [8] methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] ade4_1.7-18 plyr_1.8.6 ## [3] gridExtra_2.3 philentropy_0.5.0 ## [5] cowplot_1.1.1 scater_1.21.6 ## [7] scuttle_1.3.1 cluster_2.1.2 ## [9] factoextra_1.0.7 RColorBrewer_1.1-2 ## [11] pheatmap_1.0.12 miaViz_1.1.4 ## [13] ggraph_2.0.5 ggplot2_3.3.5 ## [15] mia_1.1.14 TreeSummarizedExperiment_2.1.4 ## [17] Biostrings_2.61.2 XVector_0.33.0 ## [19] SingleCellExperiment_1.15.2 SummarizedExperiment_1.23.4 ## [21] Biobase_2.53.0 GenomicRanges_1.45.0 ## [23] GenomeInfoDb_1.29.8 IRanges_2.27.2 ## [25] S4Vectors_0.31.4 BiocGenerics_0.39.2 ## [27] MatrixGenerics_1.5.4 matrixStats_0.61.0 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] readxl_1.3.1 backports_1.2.1 ## [3] igraph_1.2.6 lazyeval_0.2.2 ## [5] splines_4.1.1 BiocParallel_1.27.10 ## [7] digest_0.6.28 yulab.utils_0.0.2 ## [9] htmltools_0.5.2 viridis_0.6.1 ## [11] fansi_0.5.0 magrittr_2.0.1 ## [13] memoise_2.0.0 ScaledMatrix_1.1.0 ## [15] DECIPHER_2.21.0 openxlsx_4.2.4 ## [17] graphlayouts_0.7.1 colorspace_2.0-2 ## [19] blob_1.2.2 ggrepel_0.9.1 ## [21] haven_2.4.3 xfun_0.26 ## [23] dplyr_1.0.7 crayon_1.4.1 ## [25] RCurl_1.98-1.5 jsonlite_1.7.2 ## [27] ape_5.5 glue_1.4.2 ## [29] polyclip_1.10-0 gtable_0.3.0 ## [31] zlibbioc_1.39.0 DelayedArray_0.19.4 ## [33] car_3.0-11 BiocSingular_1.9.1 ## [35] abind_1.4-5 scales_1.1.1 ## [37] DBI_1.1.1 rstatix_0.7.0 ## [39] Rcpp_1.0.7 viridisLite_0.4.0 ## [41] decontam_1.13.0 gridGraphics_0.5-1 ## [43] tidytree_0.3.5 foreign_0.8-81 ## [45] bit_4.0.4 rsvd_1.0.5 ## [47] ellipsis_0.3.2 pkgconfig_2.0.3 ## [49] farver_2.1.0 sass_0.4.0 ## [51] utf8_1.2.2 ggplotify_0.1.0 ## [53] tidyselect_1.1.1 labeling_0.4.2 ## [55] rlang_0.4.11 reshape2_1.4.4 ## [57] cellranger_1.1.0 munsell_0.5.0 ## [59] tools_4.1.1 cachem_1.0.6 ## [61] DirichletMultinomial_1.35.0 generics_0.1.0 ## [63] RSQLite_2.2.8 broom_0.7.9 ## [65] evaluate_0.14 stringr_1.4.0 ## [67] fastmap_1.1.0 yaml_2.2.1 ## [69] ggtree_3.1.4 knitr_1.34 ## [71] bit64_4.0.5 tidygraph_1.2.0 ## [73] zip_2.2.0 purrr_0.3.4 ## [75] nlme_3.1-153 sparseMatrixStats_1.5.3 ## [77] aplot_0.1.1 compiler_4.1.1 ## [79] beeswarm_0.4.0 curl_4.3.2 ## [81] ggsignif_0.6.3 treeio_1.17.2 ## [83] tibble_3.1.4 tweenr_1.0.2 ## [85] bslib_0.3.0 stringi_1.7.4 ## [87] highr_0.9 forcats_0.5.1 ## [89] lattice_0.20-45 Matrix_1.3-4 ## [91] vegan_2.5-7 permute_0.9-5 ## [93] vctrs_0.3.8 pillar_1.6.3 ## [95] lifecycle_1.0.1 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [97] BiocNeighbors_1.11.0 data.table_1.14.0 ## [99] bitops_1.0-7 irlba_2.3.3 ## [101] patchwork_1.1.1 R6_2.5.1 ## [103] bookdown_0.24 rio_0.5.27 ## [105] vipor_0.4.5 MASS_7.3-54 ## [107] assertthat_0.2.1 withr_2.4.2 ## [109] GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.7 hms_1.1.1 ## [111] mgcv_1.8-37 parallel_4.1.1 ## [113] ggfun_0.0.4 beachmat_2.9.1 ## [115] tidyr_1.1.3 rmarkdown_2.11 ## [117] DelayedMatrixStats_1.15.4 carData_3.0-4 ## [119] ggpubr_0.4.0 ggnewscale_0.4.5 ## [121] ggforce_0.3.3 ggbeeswarm_0.6.0 11.6 Bibliography Robert L.

Taxa-wise variance is estimated. These values tell how much each taxa varies between samples. A curve is fitted over all those taxa-wise variance estimates that we got in the last step. This model tells how big the variance is in a specific abundance level. The model is used to shrink those individual variance estimates to avoid the effect of, e.g., small sample size and higher variance. This reduces the likelihood to get false positives. Variance estimates are used to compare different groups. We receive a result that shows whether the variance is explained by groups.
