# Getting Started

## Checklist before the course

Before the course, you should install:

#### R
miaverse requires at least version 4.1 of R. Because it takes some time to install it,
you should have it installed before the course.

Help for installing R you can find from [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

#### RStudio
RStudio is optional but preferred. It is an integrated development environment (IDE)
for R. Also installation of RStudio takes some time, so again, take this into account. 

Help for installing RStudio you can find from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/).

#### Required R packages
After installing R (and RStudio) you should install required R packages by running 
the code from [Install and load required packages / install.Rmd](install.html).

## Start workflow
After installing R (and RStudio) and required packages you should be able to start 
the workflow. 

Start it by running the code from [Install and load required packages / install.Rmd](install.html). 
If you have required packages already installed, it only loads them into the session.
